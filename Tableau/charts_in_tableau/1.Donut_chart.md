# Donut chart

Donut chart made in Tableau is an overlap of a pie chart and a circle in the middle. Donut chart being basically a pie chart must not be used to show proportion of more than 4 variables.

## Type 1: Donut chart which shows the fraction (percentage/ratio) of the whole in each category/dimension.

### Question: Make a donut chart to show percentage of sales of different segments in global superstore.

1. Start by making a pie chart.
	- Drag _Segment_ to the Colour in marks card and then select _Pie_ from the dropdown menu in the marks card.

	- And then drag _Sales_ to the newly appeared _Angle_ section in the marks card.
	![angle1](../../images/tableau/diff_viz_tableau/donut/2_angle.PNG)

	- Now select _Entire View_ in the toolbar above to increase the size of pie chart.

2. To create the inner circle 

	- Create a calculated field named __1__ and having a value `1`. 
	 ![41](../../images/tableau/diff_viz_tableau/donut/4_1.PNG)

	- Drag the newly created field __1__ to the Rows shelf and change the measure from __sum()__ to __min()__. Then create a duplicate copy of the pill __MIN(1)__

	- Increase the size of the first pie chart by increasing the size parameter in the marks card of the upper circle.

	- Now the lower pie chart must be converted to a circle so remove the dimension segment from the color section of marks card of lower circle.

3. Overlaying the pie chart and the inner circle

	- Now in the marks card section for the lower circle remove the __angle SUM(Sales)__ pill and convert the axes to dual axis so that the upper and lower circles overlap. Then increase the size of the lower circle so that the overall figure represents a donut.

	- Now change the color of the inner circle to white.

	- Now format and remove the lines, axis and headers from the sheet.
	- Now hold ctrl and drag the pills of __Segment__ and __SUM(Sales)__ to the labels' mark card of the upper circle. And do a quick table calculation to get the percentage of sales of the segments involved.

	- Now adjust the tooltip of the overall donut chart to remove the _MIN 1_.

## Type 2: KPI Donut chart

The best use of donut chart is to show KPIs, according to [Ryan Sleeper](https://evolytics.com/blog/tableau-201-how-to-make-donut-charts/):
> When used for the specific purpose of showing a metricâ€™s progress to goal, with one "slice" being the current state of the KPI and one "slice" being the remainder to goal, I think a donut chart works well. 

A disadvantage of using KPI Donut chart is that it takes up lot of space in the dashboard so the Bullet graph is better alternative. 


### Question: Make a KPI Donut chart to see whether the different regions in USA have reached the target of sales of $800,000.

1. As the dataset has data of only United States, this can be done by filtering using context filter.

2. As the global superstore dataset does not have a goal or target specified so here I will hardcode a target of $800,000 for each region in the US.
And create a calulated field __Left to goal__:

So, the resulting data we will be plotting using KPI Donut chart.

![p2_track](../../images/tableau/diff_viz_tableau/donut/p2_track.PNG)

3. Now to create a pie chart using two measures: __Sales__ and the newly created __Left to goal__. Select pie chart in the dropdown of marks card and drag __Measure Name__ dimension to the Colour Marks card and __Measure Values__ to the Angle marks card. Then filter the view on __Measure Names__ to only include __Sales__ and __Left to goal__. 
![p2_img1](../../images/tableau/diff_viz_tableau/donut/p2_img1.PNG)

4. Drag the calculated field __1__ measure to the Rows shelf and change the aggregation to minimum. Duplicate the pill __MIN(1)__ on the rows shelf and then right-click on the second pill and choose "Dual Axis". Then synchronize the axes.
![p2_sync](../../images/tableau/diff_viz_tableau/donut/p2_sync.PNG)

5. Format the sheet to remove axes, headers and zero line.
![p2_fomat](../../images/tableau/diff_viz_tableau/donut/p2_fomat.PNG)

6. Format the primary axis to increase the size of the pie chart, adding a border and most importantly: coloring the __Sales__ measure to a color of your choice (say, blue) and the __Left to goal__ to measure grey. This will eventually create the filling gauge effect in KPI we are going for.

7. Now to create a hole in the pie chart formed above use secondary axis. Remove __Measure Name__ and __Measure axis__ and change its color to white. 
![p2_sec](../../images/tableau/diff_viz_tableau/donut/p2_sec.PNG)

8. Now add dimension __Region__ to the columns shelf and drag it to the labels of the primary axis and set its alignment to top and make the labels as bold.
![alignment](../../images/tableau/diff_viz_tableau/donut/p2_alignment.png)

9. Create a calculated field named __KPI goal %ge__ to find the percentage of sales target achieved and then format it to percentage and to 2 decimal places.
And then modify the label in the secondary axis to show the KPI
![pw_labels](../../images/tableau/diff_viz_tableau/donut/pw_labels.PNG)

10. Sort __Region__ in the column shelves by the % to goal metric in descending order.

11. Resultant KPI donut chart.

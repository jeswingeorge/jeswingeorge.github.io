# Donut chart

Donut chart made in Tableau is an overlap of a pie chart and a circle. 

## Steps to make a Donut chart - Make a donut chart to show percentage of sales of different segments in global superstore.

1. Start by making a pie chart.
	- Drag _Segment_ to the Colour in marks card and then select _Pie_ from the dropdown menu in the marks card.

	- And then drag _Sales_ to the newly appeared _Angle_ section in the marks card.

	- Now select _Entire View_ in the toolbar above to increase the size of pie chart.

2. To create the inner circle 

	- Create a calculated field named __1__ and having a value `1`.

	- Drag the newly created field __1__ to the Rows shelf and change the measure from __sum()__ to __min()__. Then create a duplicate copy of the pill __MIN(1)__

	- Increase the size of the first pie chart by increasing the size parameter in the marks card of the upper circle.

	- Now the lower pie chart must be converted to a circle so remove the dimension segment from the color section of marks card of lower circle.

3. Overlaying the pie chart and the inner circle

	- Now in the marks card section for the lower circle remove the __angle SUM(Sales)__ pill and convert the axes to dual axis so that the upper and lower circles overlap. Then increase the size of the lower circle so that the overall figure represents a donut.

	- Now change the color of the inner circle to white.

	- Now format and remove the lines, axis and headers from the sheet.
	- Now hold ctrl and drag the pills of __Segment__ and __SUM(Sales)__ to the labels' mark card of the upper circle. And do a quick table calculation to get the percentage of sales of the segments involved.

	- Now adjust the tooltip of the overall donut chart to remove the _MIN 1_.
